			<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
				<p>Hello, my name is Jack, and I am an eager new participant to the world of web development. My training has been in HTML and CSS (Javascript coming soon). Below are the projects that I have worked on so far, but there is more to come. This is not my introduction to  the workforce. As noted by my resume below, I have over 7 years working in a professional environment. When I am not working or learning the trending advancements of tech, I enjoy hiking/skiing/biking the outdoors, playing both video and table top games, and spending time with friends and family (of course). Please reach out using the contact information listed below. I look forward to working with you!</p>
