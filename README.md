# Assignment: 02 Challenge Advanced CSS Portfolio

## Description

The following application is a portfolio summarizing my work in both web development and my professional career at large. This is to be viewed by perspective employers as a way of demonstrating the work I have done so far. More updates are to come both in links to additional projects and the formatting of the actual web application. There are links in the header of the web application for ease of navigation that will take the user to one of the main sections of the website. The web application is responsive to smaller screens and can be adjusted for mobile viewing.
